5:45 PM Feb 21, 2021 SIRA received a report on an upcoming
hazardous suspicious activity, from a first look, an unknown Iranian hacking group
targeted many different communities on the social media called “Discord”.
In the information we got, the group consists of 10 or more people,
experienced and beginners.
In ten minutes SIRA decided to defend against the unknown group, in hopes to
stop the crisis before it spead, SIRA saw the threat as something to take actions on
before it will be late.
Later on at 9:23 PM Feb 21, 2021, SIRA received an information about
The first victim to the
cyber attack against multiple individuals.
SIRA decided to not speak to the individual due of it happened before SIRA and
anyone else knew about the attack.
a week or more, SIRA saw it as a lost cause, but might change
their thought.
In the same day SIRA sucsessfully discovered a suspicious
payload in one of the Windows 10 1709 custom build,
the custom build of Windows 10 is made by “Discord” communities
in the same social media “Discord”, to help people optimize their performance at video
games, the custom build comes “pre-tweaked” system, without any built-in apps
of Microsoft(e.g Windows Defender), hackers are taking the opportunity to add malwares
to the systems
to manage to attack the victim easily without even thinking about anti-virus
bypasses, hackers were using a Windows application to manage to add the malware inside
the Windows 10, the name of the software would not be shown due of censorships.
Once the victim is installing the infected oparating system throught an unofficial
URL links, the malware inside the system is running in the background as soon as the
victim is booting to the system, makes everything easier for the attackers to control
victim’s oparating system.
In the first day before SIRA discovered the payload, SIRA
assumed the attackers were developing an advanced key strock recorder
(or in the real name “keylogger”),
helps the attackers to steal inforamtion quickly every amount of time and store
it in a email account or to store the log files inside a self-hosted server.
In 7:29 PM Feb 22, 2021 SIRA announce a success reverse engineering,
SIRA discovered 2 files inside the source folder,the file is not the attackers
used the methood “reverse TCP” for the attack to obtain an encrypted connection
back from the victim to the attackers, this is a popular
payload method that the attackers use.
